EJS Challenge:

I published this one with the node modules for a change. Probably won't do that again, considering how it affects the time and size of the Git push.

Module 23 of Angela Yu's course on frontend web development: this project was set up as a series of challenges involving EJS with Node and Express. I actually quite enjoyed this project, probably precisely because it was organized around challenges. I was able to solve most of the challenge prompts independently, even without hints. 
I consulted Google and Stack Overflow as necessary. For a couple of challenges, I did use the video hints. But at the end of the day, I was able to do most of the work by myself, a fact for which I was proud. After these modules, I'm feeling much more comfortable with Node and Express. I learned them in my coding bootcamp, but I had needed a refresher.
